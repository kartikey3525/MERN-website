# MERN-website (demo website)
 
## Description

This website is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js, React.js) and is designed to be fully device-responsive. It features JWT authentication for secure user registration, login, and logout, ensuring data protection and personalized user experiences.

The site highlights the firm’s dedication to customer satisfaction, showcasing an overview of the company’s work ethics and values. Key pages include:

1. Services Page: Displays detailed information about each service, including descriptions, pricing, and provider details.

2. About Page: Provides an in-depth view of the firm’s history, mission, and customer testimonials.

3. Contact Us Page: Features dynamic data extraction, tailoring the input fields based on the logged-in user's information.

The website uses a cloud-based Firestore database to fetch and update service details dynamically. The author of the database can update service information and images as needed. Users can select and book services through a user-friendly interface, with all booking details forwarded directly to the firm’s email address.

The application uses the Fetch API to interact with the MongoDB server, with Express and Node.js providing a robust backend infrastructure. Comprehensive validation and React-Toastify notifications enhance the overall user experience, making the site both functional and engaging.
